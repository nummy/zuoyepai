One of the many areas where machine learning is used is in pattern recognition, specifically in the area of classifying a “thing” as to its type. This is the overall problem we are going to address today.  </p><h3 id="The-k-nearest-neighbor-classifier"><a href="#The-k-nearest-neighbor-classifier" class="headerlink" title="The k-nearest neighbor classifier"></a>The k-nearest neighbor classifier</h3><p>A relatively simple, though potentially computationally expensive, algorithm to classifying an unknown element in terms of known elements is called a k-nearest neighbor classifier, a knn for short. It works as<br>follows. </p><p>Imagine you have two measurements you have performed on a set of objects: let’s say size and cost. We call these the features of the classification problem. You plot (in 2D for two features, in higher dimensions for more features) the location of all the known objects with respect to their feature values on a graph. You also label each of the known objects as to their known class, here indicated by the colors red and blue.  </p><p>We then place an unknown object (represented by ?), whose class we do not know, into the graph based on its features and find its k nearest neighbors, in this case k=3. The situation is shown below.</p><p>We can then answer the following questions as to what “class” the unknowns are based on their three nearest neighbors in the 2 feature space.<br>•  ?1 is a “red” thing<br>•  ?2 is a “blue” thing<br>•  ?3 is 2/3 red and 1/3 blue </p><h3 id="Your-Tasks"><a href="#Your-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Your Tasks"></a>Your Tasks</h3><p>Complete the Project 7 by writing code for the following functions. Details of type for the functions can be found in proj07_functions.h (provided for you, see details below). There are some supporting functions here that will help you solve and debug the problem. </p><p><strong>function split</strong> : <code>vector&lt;string&gt; split(const string &amp;s, char delim)</code></p><p>You supposedly wrote this for lab06. Takes in a string, splits it into its parts as separated by the character delim. In the header the default for delim is a space (note again you only do the defaults in the header, not in the code itself). Returns a vector<string> for each string in the delim separated string s. </string></p><p><strong>function read_data</strong> : <code>void read_data(map&lt;vector&lt;double&gt;, string&gt; &amp;m, unsigned int feature_count, ifstream &amp;inf)</code><br>Reads in every line of data from an already opened ifstream reference and fills in map m. Each line of<br>the file consists of feature_count features (for iris, 4). Each feature is a double and each is separated<br>by a comma. The last element is a string, the class type for this feature combination. An empty map is<br>passed in by reference and filled by the function.  </p>]]></content>

Each part will focus on different portions / stages of the ETL process.</p><h3 id="Assignment-Background"><a href="#Assignment-Background" class="headerlink" title="Assignment Background"></a>Assignment Background</h3><p>Summarizing your acquired knowledge from modules 1-4, we are going to focus on the E part of the ETL process. For reference, ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. We are going to focus here on Extract.<br>Assignment Statement</p><p>•   Read CSV files – You may use the csv module and its methods for this project.  Please see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/csv.html</a> for more information.<br>•   Load the content of the CSV files into usable records<br>•   Use polymorphism to hold data<br>•   Use inheritance to process data </p><h3 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements:"></a>Requirements:</h3><p>To extract the raw data (row) into a usable format that can be relied upon by the rest of your application, we will define the concept of a record.</p><ol><li>Create class: AbstractRecord<br>a.  This class will contain 1 (instance) member: name</li><li>Create a record class for each of the files you want to load.  When a record is referenced in the requirements, we are referring to one of the following records:<br>BaseballStatRecord or StockStatRecord.<br>And including the following functionality:<br>a.  inherit the AbstractRecord<br>b.  have an initializer method that takes the data you want to load as arguments:<br>For stocks:<br>•   Stock symbol (ticker)→ this should be stored in the “name” member<br>•   Company name (company_name)<br>•   Exchange country (exchange_country)<br>•   Stock Price (price)<br>•   Exchange Rate (exchange_rate)<br>•   Shares Outstanding (shares_outstanding)<br>•   Net Income (net_income)<br>•   Market Value in USD (market_value_usd) – This value is calculated in step 4e<br>•   Price/Earnings Ratio (pe_ratio) – This step is calculated in step 4e<br>c.  for baseball<br>•   player name → this should be stored in the “name” member<br>•   salary<br>•   G (Games played)<br>•   AVG (which is the batting average)<br>d.  For each record type, override <strong>str</strong>() (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str_</a>_ ) to return a string of the form: “<name of="" the="" record="" type=""> ( <value1>, <value2>,  &lt;…&gt; )” using “str.format”.<br>For floats please only display 2 decimal numbers (2 numbers after the comma) for monetary values and 3 decimal places for batting average.  It may be easier for you to work with USD.</value2></value1></name></li></ol><p>To load the data we are going to need a CSV reader.</p><ol start="3"><li>Create 1 AbstractCSVReader class<br>a.  The class should have an initializer method taking the path to the file to be read<br>b.  The class should have the method: row_to_record(row)<br>•   Where “row” is a row from the CSV as a dictionary<br>•   This method should be implemented by simply raising NotImplementedError.<br>c.  The class should have the method: load() that returns a list of records. Load should:<br>i.  Use “with” to open the CSV files<br>ii. read each row from the file into a dictionary: keys are the column names and values are the matching values (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader</a> )<br>iii.    call the row_to_record method and send the row as a parameter<br>iv. handle the BadData exception raised by  row_to_record by skipping the record – For more on BadData Exception see step 5<br>v.  If no exception is raised: then the record should be added to the list of records.<br>vi. Once all records are loaded into the list, returns the list.</li><li>Create a CSV reader class for each of the files you want to load<br>i.e. BaseballCSVReader and StocksCSVReader<br>a.  The class should inherit the AbstractCSVReader<br>b.  Each class should implement its own row_to_record method. The input is a dictionary of unvalidated data, it should validate the data, parse it, create new record and return the record created.<br>c.  The validation depends on your concrete record:<br>•   Validation fails for any row that is missing any piece of information<br>•   Validation fails if the name (symbol or player name) is empty<br>•   Validation fails if any of the numbers (int or float) cannot be parsed (watch out of the division by zero!!)<br>d.  If validation fails: this method should raise a BadData exception (requirement #5)<br>e.  StocksCSVReader should have two calculations using the extracted records:<br>•   market_value_usd  = Price <em> ExchangeRate </em> SharesOutstanding<br>•   pe_ratio = Price / NetIncome{}</li><li>Create a BadData custom exception to handle record creation errors</li><li>From your main section ( <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html</a> )<br>a.  load the CSV (e.g.  BaseballCSVReader(‘path to my CSV’).load())<br>b.  Print each record to the console. You are to use: print(record)</li></ol>]]></content>

      <title>Python代写: Tic Tac Toe</title>
      <link href="/archives/5f7999b1.html"/>
      <url>/archives/5f7999b1.html</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>实现tic tac toe 算法，无论怎么下，都是赢</p><h1 id="Homework-4-Tic-Tac-Toe"><a href="#Homework-4-Tic-Tac-Toe" class="headerlink" title="Homework 4: Tic Tac Toe"></a>Homework 4: Tic Tac Toe</h1><p>Tic Tac Toe – child’s play, right?  You probably know that perfectly played games will always result in a draw.  In this assignment you will implement a computer’s strategy for the game.</p><p>You will play against a random player – a “monkey.”  Let’s call him Harry.  Since Harry plays randomly, you will beat him most of the time.  But here’s the thing: Harry is insatiable.  He LOVES tic tac toe and will happily play 10,000 games in a row.  Since every single move is random, he might pull some things you wouldn’t expect.   You will each start about half the matches.</p><p>You may work in pairs for this assignment.  So we know whom to credit, both of your names should be at the top of t3.py (replacing mine).</p><p>The assignment is due Wednesday October 25th at 1:30am.  You can check it out here.</p><p>Your noble adversary.</p><h2 id="Your-Task"><a href="#Your-Task" class="headerlink" title="Your Task"></a>Your Task</h2><p>In this repository, you will find t3.py, human_match.py, and monkey_match.py.</p><p>Running ./human_match.py starts an interactive match against the computer, while ./monkey_match.py launches 10000 games between the computer a random player (monkey).  The former will probably prove useful for debugging; the latter will serve for your grade.  After your initial check-out, computer will play randomly – just like the monkey.</p><p>The classes you will maniuplate are in t3.py.  Check out the documentation by doing pydoc t3 from the command line.</p><p>You will find a game class, as well as three player classes.  The former includes a board and defines the game play.  The board is defined as a list 9 elements long that initially consists of copies of None and is filled in with X’s and O’s with each move.  The indexing runs across rows and then down columns, as shown.  If you print the game, it will convert the board to string, and should be readily comprehensible.  The game also takes care of switching back and forth between the two players, eliciting moves from each, rejecting invalid moves (filled squares), and ultimately declaring a winner.  </p><p>The player class is inherited by monkey, human, and computer.  Each of these players can can do two things – be initialized to play X’s or O’s, and render a move when presented with a board.</p><p>You will implement the computer’s move() function.  This is part of a class (woohoo!), but all of your work should be restricted to that single function.  I suggest that you implement the Newell &amp; Simon strategy from the Wikipedia page.  Though your computer will start all its matches in the center (boring!), this is a self-consistent strategy that will never lose.  You can use other strategies if you want, but TAs will issue partial credit for the following defined steps:</p><ol><li>Win if possible</li><li>Block your opponent from winning.</li><li>Create a fork</li><li>Force your opponent to play defense, if it does not result in a fork.</li><li>Block your opponent from taking a fork.</li><li>Take the center.</li><li>Take a corner opposite your opponent.</li><li>Take an empty corner.</li><li>Take a side.</li></ol><p>A skeleton for this approach is already defined for you.  Further, game already implements check_for_wins() and check_for_twos(), which should prove useful to you in evaluating the conditions.</p><p>Of these strategies, #4 may be particularly difficult.  You can see code for it below, if you get stuck.</p><p><details><summary>Strategy for #4, “Force Defense”</summary><br>We’re interested in forcing your opponent to play defense, but only if it does not result in a fork for them.  The first condition just means that we create a two that they have have to block.  The second piece means that that two must not give them a fork – a sure-win.  We can do this easily, by making a copy of the game – hypo_match, below – and seeing how the game would play out, looking one move ahead.<br><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># Get posible squares to play for a "two"</span></span><br><span class="line">self_twos = match.check_for_twos(self.mark)</span><br><span class="line">  </span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># We'll now consider hypothetical games, </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># where we play in each of the "two" positions.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> self_twos:                 <span class="comment"># For each of these</span></span><br><span class="line">    hypo_match = dc(match)          <span class="comment"># create a copy of the game -- dc is deepcopy</span></span><br><span class="line">    hypo_match.board[i] = self.mark <span class="comment"># try playing there.</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Now look for the win implied by your "two".</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Your opponent would have to play here.</span></span><br><span class="line">    w = hypo_match.check_for_wins(self.mark) </span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># For your OPPPONENT, get any potential twos.</span></span><br><span class="line">    hypo_twos = hypo_match.check_for_twos(self.other_mark)</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># If your potential win is not just a two for them,</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># but in fact a DOUBLE two -- a fork -- don't move here!</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> w <span class="keyword">in</span> hypo_twos <span class="keyword">and</span> hypo_twos[w] &gt; <span class="number">1</span>: <span class="keyword">continue</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Otherwise, it meets the condition.
