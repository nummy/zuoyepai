### Instructions

Work out the answers to these problems manually without the use of a computer.  This will 
help you develop the ability to read and analyze code.  Problems of this type will also appear 
on exams.  After coming up with answers manually, write test code to check whether you have 
solved the problems correctly. 

### Problems
```java
double d1 = 3 / 2 * 3.0 + 8 / 3; 
double d2 = 2.0 * 4 / 5 + 6 / 4.0;
System.out.println( d1 );
System.out.println( d2 );
```

1) When the code in Figure 1 runs, what does it output to the console? (5 points)

```java
System.out.println("2+3=" + 2 + 3);
System.out.println(1 + 2 + "3");
System.out.println("2*3=" + 2 * 3);
System.out.println(4 - 1 + "x");
System.out.println("x" + 4 - 1);
```

2) When the code in Figure 2 runs, what does it output to the console? (5 points)

```java
System.out.println((double) 2 + 3 / 2);
System.out.println((double) (2 + 3) / 2);
System.out.println((double) 22 / 4);
System.out.println(22 / (double) 4);
System.out.println((double) (22 / 4));
```

3) When the code in Figure 3 runs, what does it output to the console? (5 points)
