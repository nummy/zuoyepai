使用QT实现一个聊天室。

Your task is to create a peer to peer chat program with Qt. You have been given networking code that finds and connects to peers on the local network and a GUI that demonstrates the basics of how the networking code is used. 

You must extend the given project to provide user profile support, images, private chatrooms and private 

messaging. 

The program's interface must allow the user to do the following: 
- Set their nickname (aka username or handle). 
- Set user profile details, including an image file, time zone and location. 
- Send messages. 
- Send private messages to users. 
- Create private chatrooms. 
- Invite users to private chatrooms. 
- Join private chatrooms. 
- Kick users from private rooms. 
- Send files to rooms. 
- Send files to users. 
- Save chat transcripts to files (excluding exchanged files) 

The program will be using Qt, and will need to utilise the Qt data types. 
The supplied networking code handles passing messages between clients, and all running clients (on the same local network) automatically connect to each other in the main (public) chatroom. The code in the Networking folder will not need modification.
