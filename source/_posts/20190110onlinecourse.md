### CSE 231

Introduction to Programming I
Spring Semester, 2019 

### Description

Introduction to programming using Python. Design, implementation and testing of programs to solve problems primarily in engineering, mathematics and science. Programming fundamentals, functions, classes, lists, and dictionaries.

### Objectives

In this course, students will study general programming concepts, as well as a modern programming language which illustrates those concepts. Students will design, implement and test Python programs.

At the end of this course when presented with a problem we expect that a student with respond: "Hey, I can write a program to do that!"

### Highlights

You are responsible for all the details in the syllabus below, but here are highlights.

Grade Points: 1000 points from weekly programming projects, exercises, and three exams.
Labs including pre-labs are required: your final grade will be reduced if you miss more than two.
If you collaborate on programming projects, you will get a zero.
We frequently send email from msu.edu and cse.msu.edu . It is important that you ensure that your email client isn't routing our emails to Junk -- otherwise you will miss critical email about the course.

### Due Dates

The Due Dates Page is your guide to due dates for the semester: https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/due_dates.html 

To allow some flexibility:

- Programming Projects: late submissions are reduced 50% for up to one day late; no credit after one day.
Labs : Contact your TA about any extenuating circumstances before lab. Old labs cannot be made up.
Except for extreme circumstances (e.g. a car crash puts you overnight in a hospital) there will be no other extensions.
- Due times are U.S. Eastern Standard Time. Mimir uses your computer's time setting to display time in your browser so if your computer's time is set to a different time zone, you will be misled by displayed due dates and times.

### Course Grades

Each student's course grade will be based on the sum of the points earned in the following categories (points are different for the Honors Section): 

- Examinations    (45% of total course points)
- Computer Projects   (45% of total course points)
- Chapter Exercises   (10% of total course points)

To be eligible to earn a non-zero grade in the course, a student normally must earn at least 50% of the total points for the examinations and earn at least 50% of the total points for the computer projects.

The following table gives the scale for course grades: 

- 4.0 90% of points available
- 3.5 85% of points available
- 3.0 80% of points available
- 2.5 75% of points available
- 2.0 70% of points available
- 1.5 65% of points available
- 1.0 60% of points available

The instructor reserves the right to adjust the scale for course grades, if necessary. 

Important: Students who get a zero ("no credit") on more than two (2) laboratory exercises will have their course grade reduced by 0.5 for each laboratory exercise missed beyond two. For example, if a student had sufficient points to normally earn a 3.0, but zeros four (4) laboratory exercises, that student's grade will be reduced by 2*0.5 to a 2.0 course grade.
