使用R编写小游戏TicTacToe，专业代写R语言作业，Assignment，Project，保证原创。

Please do your best to complete this assignment on your own, and resist the temptation to look at someone else's solution, or to copy someone else's work.

Students who are found to be in violation of the policies regarding academic integrity will be reported to the dean of students.

You will get out of this class what you put in. You will only get better at coding if you challenge yourself. This assignment is intended to be challenging, but not insurmountable. Your code need not be very complicated. You will NOT be graded on coding efficiency, but so you have an idea, my implementation is 145 lines of code.


```{r}
# These are some recommendations for tic-tac-toe:
# You are welcome to implement the game another way.
# You will be graded on whether your game works or not. Point details are in the HW assignment instructions.

# First, there are 8 ways to win. I have stored them as a list called triples.

triples <- list(
  c(1,2,3),
  c(4,5,6),
  c(7,8,9),
  c(1,4,7),
  c(2,5,8),
  c(3,6,9),
  c(1,5,9),
  c(3,5,7)
)


# The `state` of the game can be stored as a character vector of length 9. 
# I used NA for spots that were unplayed, and entered "x" and "o" as the game progressed.
# For example, when I start the game, I made a vector called state with 9 NAs
# state
# [1] NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA 
# Let's say 'x' plays in the middle spot (position 5)
# the state becomes:
# [1] NA  NA  NA  NA  "x" NA  NA  NA  NA 


# When I created the game, I created the following functions:

# display(state)  
# displays the current state of the board.

# prompt_user(who, state)
# prompts the user for where they want to play.
# checks to see if the move is legal or not

# update(state, who, pos)  
# updates the state of the board by putting an x or o (who) 
# in the designated position (pos) 

# computer_turn(state)  
# has the computer take a turn. The input is the state.
# The function returns the position where the computer will play.

# check_winner(state)   
# checks if there is a winner.

# play() # the 'wrapping' function that lets you play a game by combining the above functions.



# The display(state) function presents the board as a 3x3 grid with numbers in the positions as follows.
# I used cat() with the state vector to create the board
#  x | 2 | 3  
# ---+---+---
#  4 | o | 6  
# ---+---+---
#  7 | 8 | 9

# As the game progresses, the display function should output the current state of the game board. For example:
  
# The function `update(state, who, pos)` takes the current state of the game and puts in an 'x' or 'o' in the designated position. 
# This function should be very simple to implement.

# The `computer_turn` function reads the current board and returns where it will play next. 
# The `computer_turn` is able to deduce whether the computer is playing as x or as o.
# The function also implements some basic strategy (wins and blocks).

# The `play` function puts everything together.

# The function first asks if there is one or two human players. 
# If there is one human player, it asks if the human will play first or second.

# I've outlined in psuedo-code how I imagine you can set up the play function:

# 
# play <- function(){
# # determine game conditons: 1 or 2 players. If computer plays, is it player 1 or 2.
# # initialize game board

# # while( no winner ){
# # x's turn
# display() # display board 
# # x chooses where to play. prompt_user() or computer_turn()
# update() # update board
# check_winner() # if x wins - quit loop
# # o's turn
# display() # display board 
# # o chooses where to play. prompt_user() or computer_turn()
# update() # update board
# check_winner() # if o wins - quit loop
# }
# # display final board state and who the winner is
# }

# These are recommendations that I make for programming the game. 
# You are welcome to implement the game another way.
# You will be graded on whether your game works or not. Point details are in the HW assignment instructions.
